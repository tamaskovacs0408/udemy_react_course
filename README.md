# React course

## The best practice to get the most updated states:

1. 

```js
...
const [state, setState] = useState(0);

const handleState = () => {
  setState(previousState => previousState + 1)
}
```

2. 
```js
...
 const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState({
     enteredTitle: "",
     enteredAmount: "",
     enteredDate: "",
   });

  const handleTitleInput = (e) => {
     setUserInput((previousState) => {
       return { ...previousState, enteredTitle: e.target.value };
     });
  };

  const amountChangeHandler = (e) => {
     setUserInput((previousState) => {
       return { ...previousState, enteredAmount: e.target.value };
     });
  };

  const dateChangeHandler = (e) => {
     setUserInput((previousState) => {
       return { ...previousState, enteredDate: e.target.value };
     });
  };
  ...
```

## Passing data from child to parent

The parent sends a function to child to get the data

1. Create a function in the parent to get the data

2. Send the function to child

3. Force the child to give the data into the function

4. The function gives back the data to the parent

In react we cannot pass data between two children components directly, but we can do it as passing the data to their parent component and from there we can get the data to the child component.

## Styling

Dynamically adding style (with adding classes) to component:

If the `isValid` state is not true, it adds the `invalid` class after the `form-control` class.

```js
...
<div className={`form-control ${!isValid ? "invalid" : ""}`}>
...
```

### Styled Components

Installation:

`npm install --save styled-components`

We can pass prop into the styled components. If it passed, it can be used inside the styled component's ``-s.

```js
...
background: ${props => props.invalid ? "rgba(250, 128, 114, 0.829)" : "transparent"};
...
```

Media-queries can be added to styled components too, just add it to the "main" style and pass the properties you'd like to change.

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  width: 100%;
  font: inherit;
  padding: 0.5rem 1.5rem;
  border: 1px solid #8b005d;
  color: white;
  background: #8b005d;
  box-shadow: 0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.26);
  cursor: pointer;

  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    width: auto;
  }
`
```

### CSS modules

React projects have to be configured to css modules. The npm's `create-react-app` project is configured to css modules by default.

The filename have to contains the `module` keyword. => `Button.module.css`

In the component, import named the `module.css` file (the name is totally up to you). => `import styles from "./Button.module.css"`

Then the css classes have to be added with the following syntax: (the class name, as it defined in the css file)

```js
import styles from "./Button.module.css"
...
<div className={styles.button} >
    ...
</div>    
```

If the class name not just a single word, but contains `-` or sg else, use the `styles["class-name"]` syntax to get the class.

We can also use dynamical rendering with css modules too.

```js
<div className={`${styles["form-control"]} ${!isValid ? styles.invalid : null}`}> ...
```

Media queries works as like as in common css files.


### Accept incoming css classes from another component

If we'd like to apply a class to a component, which is comes from another component (e.g. a Card component is wrapped around a div, and we'd like to add the div's css classes to the Card, but the Card has it's own classes already) we have to add the component className a template literal. First, we add the class it has already, and then the secondary class, which is given by props (object destructuring).

```js
// Outer component
<Card outerClass={style.classStyle}></Card>

// Card component
const Card = ({outerClass}) => {
  ...
  <div className={`${style.card} ${outerClass}`}>{children}</div>
  ...
}


```
