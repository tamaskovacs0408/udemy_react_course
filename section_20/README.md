# Routing

First, we need to install the React Router via `npm i react-router-dom`

## Setup #1

Import `createBrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`, and call it with the router settings:

- path: The url path of the page
- element: Which component to be rendered when the route (in the path) is active

Also import `RouterProvider` and return it with the component(we can add or wrap it with more JSX code). This provider has a `router` prop, which takes the router's settings.

```js
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";

const routerSettings = createBrowserRouter([
  {path: "/", element: <Homepage />},
  {}
])

function App() {
    return <RouterProvider router={routerSettings}>
}

```
