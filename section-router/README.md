# Routing

First, we need to install the React Router via `npm i react-router-dom`

## Setup #1

Import `createBrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`, and call it with the router settings:

- path: The url path of the page
- element: Which component to be rendered when the route (in the path) is active

Also import `RouterProvider` and return it with the component(we can add or wrap it with more JSX code). This provider has a `router` prop, which takes the router's settings.

```js
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";

const routerSettings = createBrowserRouter([
  {path: "/", element: <Homepage />},
  {}
])

function App() {
    return <RouterProvider router={routerSettings}>
}

```

### Setup #2

Alternative way to routes:

In the `index.js` file import `BrowserRouter`, and wrap it around the `App` component.

```js
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
....

root.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
)
```

In the `app.js` file we can set up the routes. Import `Routes` and `Route` from "react-router-dom". Wrap `Routes` around the `Route`(s). We can nest `Route` into each oder (to make subroutes), but `Routes` have to be around the `Route`s.

```js
import {Routes, Route} from "react-router-dom";
...

function App() {
    return (
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />}>
            <Route path="/products" element={<ProductPage />}>
        </Routes>
    )
}
```

## Navigating

### Link

To navigate between pages, use the React Router's `Link`.
It has a `to=""` attribute where we can tell it where to navigate.

```js
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
...

<>
    <p>Go back to <Link to="/">Homepage</Link></p>
</>
```

### NavLink

The other way to navigate between pages is the `NavLink` component.
It's a better way, when we using a navigation bar, because we can set active style for the active links. It's `className` works like a normal className, but you can also pass it a function to customize the classNames applied based on the active and pending state of the link. The `isActive` and the `isPending` are coming from the `React Router Dom`.

```js
<NavLink
  to="/messages"
  className={({ isActive, isPending }) =>
    isPending ? "pending" : isActive ? "active" : ""
  }
>
  Messages
</NavLink>
```

#### end

The `end` prop changes the matching logic for the active and pending states to only match to the "end" of the NavLink's to path. If the URL is longer than to, it will no longer be considered active.

Without the end prop, this link is always active because every URL matches /.

```js
<NavLink to="/" end>
  Home
</NavLink>
```

Now this link will only be active at "/".

### useNavigate

**It's usually better to use `redirect` in loaders and `actions` than this hook!**

The useNavigate hook returns a function that lets you navigate programmatically, for example in an effect:

```js
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

function useLogoutTimer() {
  const userIsInactive = useFakeInactiveUser();
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (userIsInactive) {
      fake.logout();
      navigate("/session-timed-out");
    }
  }, [userIsInactive]);
}
```

The navigate function has two signatures:

Either pass a `To` value (same type as `<Link to>`) with an optional second `{ replace, state }` arg or
Pass the delta you want to go in the history stack. For example, `navigate(-1)` is equivalent to hitting the back button.
If using `replace: true`, the navigation will replace the current entry in the history stack instead of adding a new one.

## Layout

If we'd like to have a layout which wraps around all the components, we have to make some modification for the router.

In the file, where our router was created, create another route in the `createBrowserRouter`. This route has the default, homepages ("/") path, the element is the created `Layout` element, and has a `childrenË›` property, which takes an array where we put all the router we'd like to wrapped around the layout. It tells the router, that the layout is the "parent" of this routes.

```js
...
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <Layout />,
    children: [
      { index: true, element: <HomePage /> },
      { path: "/products", element: <ProductsPage /> },
    ],
  },
]);
```

In the layout's component render the `Outlet` from `"react-router-dom"`. Put this `Outlet` into the layout's return section, because this `Outlet` marks where the layout's children routes(components) should be rendered. (Which set up at the app.js).
If we have a component for navigation (and we'd like to show it on every page), put it ABOVE the `Outlet` and now it is rendered on every page wrapped around the layout.

```js
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

function Layout() {
    return (
        <h1>Root Layout</h1>
        <MainNav />
        <Outlet />
    )
}
```
